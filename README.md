### 3. SQL Data Project
[Publication](https://github.com/naokoi0408/SQL/blob/main/SQL/SQL.RStudio.pdf)

The analysis compares median annual salaries across companies of different sizes, finding that companies with around 1000 employees pay between $250,000 and $260,000, while larger mega-companies offer slightly higher median salaries of $268,000 to $275,000. This highlights a trend of increasing salaries with company size.
- Skills: SQL, database management, data transformation.

### 4. Hypothesis Testing and Estimators
[Publication](https://github.com/naokoi0408/HypothesisTesting/blob/main/Hypothesis_Testing/HypothesisTesting.pdf)

Hypothesis testing in these regressions evaluates whether the independent variables (like education level or region) have a statistically significant impact on the dependent variables (like median income or commute behavior). It tests whether the observed relationships are due to chance, with the null hypothesis assuming no effect and the alternative suggesting a significant effect.
- Skills: Statistics, R/Python, hypothesis testing.
